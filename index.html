        I was born in Tianjin, China in 1993 and has been living there before I was 18. 
        In 2011, I was admitted into <a href="http://en.hhu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Hohai University</a> hence started my career in water engineering ever since. After completing my B.E. in Agricultural Water Conservancy Engineering in 2015, I went to <a href="https://uci.edu/" target="_blank">UC Irvine</a> to continue my study in Hydrology & Water Resources as a master student. I spent a little bit more than two happy years there and graguated. After that I went back to my home country in 2017 and has been working at the <a href="http://www.craes.cn/en/" target="_blank">CRAES</a> in Beijing, China for a while.<br>
        In 2019, I came back to the U.S to pursue my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4D4Lfy4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Tiantian Yang</a> at the <strong>University of Oklahoma</strong> at Norman.<br>
        I am particularly interested in computational modeling and optimization theory.
