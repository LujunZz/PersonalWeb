     		I was born in Tianjin, China in 1993 and has been living there until I turned 18. In 2011, I was admitted into <a href="http://en.hhu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Hohai University</a> and started my career in water engineering ever since. After completing my B.E. in Agricultural Water Conservancy Engineering in 2015, I went to <a href="https://uci.edu/" target="_blank">UC Irvine</a> to continue my study in Hydrology & Water Resources as a master student. I went back to China with my Master's in 2017 and worked at the <a href="http://www.craes.cn/en/" target="_blank">CRAES</a>  in China for a while.<br>
     		In 2019, I came back to the U.S again and am currently a PhD student at the <strong>University of Oklahoma</strong> at Norman.<br>
     		I am particularly interested in computational modeling and optimization theory.
